# SimplexSolver
The project is capabale of solving L.P (Linear programming) optimization problems and tell how are the answers.
A Linear Programming problem can lead to 4 different answers:
1 - The problem has unique optimized answer.
2 - The problem has alternative optimized answers.
3 - Feasible region of problem in infinite ( There are infinite number of answers for the problem.
4 - The problem cannot be solved
