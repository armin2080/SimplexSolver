# SimplexSolver
## The project is capabale of solving L.P (Linear programming) optimization problems and tell how are the answers.
## A Linear Programming problem can lead to 4 different answers:
1. The problem has unique optimized answer.
2. The problem has alternative optimized answers.
3. Feasible region of problem in infinite ( There are infinite number of answers for the problem.
4. The problem cannot be solved
> The project also plots equations if the count of variables equal 2.
------------------------------------------
> To run the project you must have `python` , `matplotlib` , `PyQt5` and `Numpy` installed.
------------------------------------------
### For example let's say we have the problem below:

### Note that to enter problem , you must write variables and numbers just like it is written on the picture.
------------------------------------------
### after clicking "calculate" second tab shows up and we can see the first form of simplex table.

### Also because we have only 2 variables , The programm plots subjects:

### by clicking on "next" and "prev" buttons you can iterate through different levels of solving the problem using simplex method. In the last ### step, the programm show the output of problem:
